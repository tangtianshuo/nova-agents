//! Centralized system binary discovery for GUI applications.
//!
//! **All** system binary lookups MUST use `system_binary::find()` instead of
//! raw `which::which()`. Tauri apps launched from Finder/launchd don't inherit
//! shell PATH (no `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, etc.), so bare
//! `which::which("npm")` fails even when npm is installed.
//!
//! This follows the same "pit of success" pattern as [`crate::local_http`]
//! and [`crate::process_cmd`]: the correct behavior is the default — callers
//! don't need to remember platform-specific PATH augmentation.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use crate::system_binary;
//!
//! if let Some(npm) = system_binary::find("npm") {
//!     let mut cmd = process_cmd::new(&npm);
//!     cmd.arg("install").arg("some-package");
//! }
//! ```
